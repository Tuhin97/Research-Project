# Exploring the Role of Large Language Models in Network Security

This repository contains all Python notebooks, datasets, and visual results used for the research project  
**“Exploring the Role of Large Language Models in Network Security”**  
conducted by **Tuhin Anand (a1930716)** as part of the **Master of Computer Science (University of Adelaide, 2025)**.

## Overview

This project investigates how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can enhance **network intrusion detection systems (IDS)** by combining  
semantic embeddings from pretrained transformer models — **GPT-2, Gemma, MiniLM, BAAI (bge-base), and LLaMA-2** —  
with traditional classifiers (**Decision Tree**, **Extra Trees**, and **Random Forest**).

The objective is to evaluate whether contextual LLM embeddings improve detection accuracy, recall, and generalization  
across benchmark cybersecurity datasets — **NSL-KDD**, **UNSW-NB15**, and **TON-IoT**.
